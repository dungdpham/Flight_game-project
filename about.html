            <p>The game sets out with a single character: Alisa, who is a high school fresh graduate from Finland. She
                decides to have a gap year before going to enroll to universities to explore the world. Thus, she plans
                to have a small adventure and visit a city in every continent, starting with only 600€ in her pocket. To
                finance her trip, she prepares to do different type of jobs in the cities that she is going to
                visit.<br>

                <br>Alisa draws her own route which continent to go next, following the order: from Finland to Europe,
                and
                then Africa, Asia, Oceania, North America, South America and from there she will fly back to
                Finland.<br>

                <br>However, the destination city from each continent is unknown to her. Throughout the game, before the
                trip to a continent, Alisa will be offered three randomly generated cities and the accompanying fight
                tickets to those cities. The higher the ticket price she pays, the higher daily salary she can get from
                that destination, which is determined by a fixed rate based on the ticket prices.<br>

                <br>Alisa will then have to decide how many days she is going to stay in that destination before she can
                fly
                off to the next. If the stay’s duration is too short, she won’t get enough money to purchase ticket to
                the next destination of her desire. A penalty is introduced at this point: Alisa will have to stay extra
                minimum number of days required at the current location to be able to buy the next ticket, with the rate
                of only 50% what she can earn before choosing the stay’s duration. Thus, she needs to think and decide
                careful how many days she will stay and earn how much money.<br>

                <br>By this logic, she needs to finish her tour around the world with the shortest time and pay the
                lowest
                amount of money for the flights.<br>

                <br>The total number of days Alisa spends in the chosen cities is used as the main goal of the game. The
                lower this number is, the higher the player is placed on the score board. In case there are different
                game IDs with the same number of travelled days, the total cost for flight tickets will be used as the
                secondary goal, with the lower cost placed higher on score board.<br>
